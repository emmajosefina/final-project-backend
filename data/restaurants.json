        "description": "Internationally known chefs Adam Dahlberg and Albin Wessman transformed this space into something more modern and relaxed than a fine dining venue. The menu starts with a selection of elaborate snacks chosen by the chefs, followed by four dishes that change daily. The signature hand-cut beef tartare evolves with the season. It might be served with roasted almonds and white miso, or it might come as a lamb tartare. The cooking here is based firmly in Sweden’s gastronomic heritage, but you can also sense influences from French and other European kitchens.",

At Operakällaren, you can travel back in time with flambé and silver-plated trolleys without sacrificing modern tastes.",
